CellMotion
==========

code simulating cell motion using Level-Set Method

driver files:

cell_Motion_2d.m simulates two dimensional movement of cells.

molecule_Interation.m simulates interaction between molecules.

convectionDiffusionFlow.m simulates convection and diffusion on a zero level set of specific shapes and plots the output.

meanCurFlow.m is an example of mean curvatures flow using the level-set method.  The file currently runs mean curvature flow of a square implicitly represented as the zero-level set of a linear function.

sweepCurvatureFlow.m uses the sweeping method to calculate the flow.
